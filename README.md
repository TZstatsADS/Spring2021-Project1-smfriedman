### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Perception of Facts During the 2016 Election
+ This project is conducted by Steven Friedman

+ Project summary: In the era of ["alternative facts,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts) different groups maintain different views on reality. This has demonstrable implications for politics, public health, etc., and it matters whether the American electorate believes that an election was free and fair or whether vaccines work. At the same time, Americans are consuming media in different ways. Social media is becoming a more prevalent source for political news, and echo chambers have ostensibly contributed to increased polarization on fact-based issues. In this analysis, voters' confidence in their understanding of political issues is reconciled with their understanding of the facts. For voters of different age groups, political affiliations, and social media habits, perception and reality are compared with respect to government, the economy, and misinformation. Attention was taken to compare views on objective facts as opposed to opinions or ethics.
